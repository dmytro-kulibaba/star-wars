# StarWars

To start working with the project please clone the repository.
Then go to the project root and run `npm install`. After that, you are able to start a Dev server or build the production artifact.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
